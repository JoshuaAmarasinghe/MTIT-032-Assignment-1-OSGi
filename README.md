# MTIT-032-Assignment-1-OSGi
 OSGi  framework and its underlying architecture, service intercommunication in OSGi Framework, registering services and lifecycle implementation of OSGi bundles.

# OSGi Assignment 01

# Guidelines :-
A. Assignment is an open-ended assignment. Creativity is up to you to decide. 
B. This is similar to the practical example given in Apache Equinox Lab practical. You 
have to develop your own publisher-subscriber scenario. 
C. You can use Apache Equinox OSGi framework or any OSGi framework for the 
deployment. (Use Eclipse IDE for the implementation) 
D. Marks will be allocated for given deliverables, and marking scheme is given below. 
E. You will be given deadline on 5th March 2023 (Late submissions are not accepted; 50% 
marks will be decreased from overall marks any delay or the failure to conduct Viva) 
F. The group should represent maximum of 4 members.
G. If the code has been directly copied from the internet or from a pier at any level, it 
will be considered as a plagiarism act and dealt with accordingly. (Please note that we 
will be using software to check for any plagiarism) 

# Question: 
You should implement the Producer â€“ Consumer scenario using OSGi framework. You have 
to implement separate service bundle (or bundles) as producer (or producers) and to consume 
that service (or services), there should be a consumer bundle (or bundles). You should establish 
service communication among producer and consumer. 
Each member should implement at least 01 producer and 01 consumer (per group there 
should be 04 producers and 04 consumers). If a member can implement more than that and 
consider more complex scenario in creative manner more marks will be offered under the 
complexity category of the scenario.
